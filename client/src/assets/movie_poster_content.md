# Movie poster in AR: The Gold Rush (Chaplin)

## NÃ­vel
Basic

## DescriÃ§Ã£o
Animated scene and music to bring Chaplin's Gold Rush movie poster to life.

## Experience Overview ðŸ“–

This is a simple experience, whose objective is to give life to a physical element represented by a visual image, in this case the poster of a mythical film by Charles Chaplin. Thanks to the augmented reality web we can associate this poster to an animated scene, where different elements of the image come to life. In this case a 3D scene is added with a series of animations already included (Chaplin's character waving, letters with movement and brightness, etc.); and a background sound is also associated to the scene that provides an extra layer of communication with the end user.

## Uses and Benefits ðŸŒ±

Example of an experience related to the world of **experiential marketing**. Through web AR we can bring a static graphic content to life, and thus turn an experience such as a movie poster into an element that can tell a more elaborate and animated story to the end user.

## Features and Tips ðŸ’¡

The following Onirix features are used in this experience:
